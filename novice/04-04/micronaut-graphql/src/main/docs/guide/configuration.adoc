Micronaut 1.0.3 or above is required and you must have the `micronaut-graphql` dependency on your classpath:

dependency:micronaut-graphql[version="{version}", groupId="io.micronaut.graphql"]

The `micronaut-graphql` module transitively includes the `com.graphql-java:graphql-java` dependency and provides a Micronaut
`GraphQLController` which enables query execution via HTTP.

As outlined in https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http the following HTTP requests are supported:

* `GET` request with `query`, `operationName` and `variables` query parameters. The `variables` query parameter must be json encoded.
* `POST` request with `application/json` body and keys `query` (String), `operationName` (String) and `variables` (Map).

Both produce a `application/json` response.

By default the GraphQL endpoint is exposed on `/graphql` but this can be changed via the `graphql.path` application property.

.src/main/resources/application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
graphql:
  enabled: true // <1>
  path: /graphql // <2>
----
<1> Enables/disables the GraphQL integration. Default `true`.
<2> Configures the GraphQL endpoint path. Default `/graphql`.

You only must configure a bean of type `graphql.GraphQL` containing the GraphQL schema and runtime wiring.
